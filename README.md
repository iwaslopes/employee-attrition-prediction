# Employee Outcomes Analysis: Productivity, Attrition & Promotion

## 📊 Project Overview
This project investigates how work-from-home arrangements and employee characteristics influence key workforce outcomes: productivity, employee attrition, and promotion or role changes. Using regression modeling in R, the analysis identifies the most important drivers of these outcomes and translates the results into actionable business recommendations for management.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Examine how remote work and employee characteristics relate to productivity, attrition, and promotions
- Identify the strongest predictors of employee performance and turnover
- Interpret regression results in clear business terms
- Provide evidence-based recommendations to support HR and management decision-making

## 🧠 Methodology
The analysis follows three main steps:
1. Data preparation and validation, including merging datasets and verifying variable consistency
2. Regression modeling using appropriate techniques:
   - Linear regression (OLS) for continuous outcomes such as productivity
   - Binary outcome models (Logit/Probit/LPM) for attrition and promotion
3. Interpretation of results focusing on practical business implications rather than purely statistical significance

## 💡 Key Contribution
The project demonstrates how people analytics can be used to support strategic workforce decisions, particularly regarding flexible work arrangements and employee retention policies.

## 📌 Note
This project was developed as part of the MSc in Business Analytics at Católica Lisbon. Data used is academic and anonymized.
